# National-Health-Facilities-Overview-
Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive data analysis and interactive dashboard on the state of health facilities in Nigeria.
The goal of this analysis is to move beyond just counting facilities and instead evaluate functionality, distribution, and infrastructure gaps across states and local government areas (LGAs).
Using data analytics and visualization techniques, this dashboard provides insights that can support data-driven healthcare planning and resource allocation.
 Objectives
Analyze the total number of health facilities in Nigeria
Determine the percentage of functional vs non-functional facilities
Identify states with the highest number of facilities
Highlight states with the highest number of non-functional facilities
Examine LGAs with the highest concentration of facilities
Analyze facility types (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary)
Reveal regional imbalances in healthcare infrastructure
Key Insights
46,000 total health facilities identified nationwide
34,000 functional facilities (74.29%)
12,000 non-functional facilities (25.71%)
Primary healthcare centers make up the majority of facilities
Some states have high facility counts but also high non-functionality rates
Infrastructure is concentrated in certain states and LGAs
The analysis shows that infrastructure availability does not always guarantee performance, emphasizing the importance of maintenance, funding, staffing, and effective resource allocation.
Tools & Technologies Used
Microsoft Power BI – Dashboard creation & data visualization

 Why This Project Matters
Healthcare infrastructure plays a critical role in national development. By leveraging data analytics, this project helps:
Identify gaps in healthcare service delivery
Support evidence-based decision-making
Highlight areas requiring urgent intervention
Promote transparency in public health infrastructure analysis
This project demonstrates how data visualization can transform raw data into actionable insights for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders.
 Future Improvements
Add interactive drill-through analysis by state
Integrate real-time or updated datasets
Perform predictive analysis on functionality trends
Deploy dashboard to Power BI Service for public access
